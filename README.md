# Chatapp

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Inside the dev.exs file you need to enter you own credentials
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

The login system is not ready so you just need to append your user to the url like that:  http://localhost:4000/?user=yourName
Login from different tabs and voil√† now you can chat realtime with yourself by yourself :P
